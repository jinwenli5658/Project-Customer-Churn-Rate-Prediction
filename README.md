# Project: Customer Churn Rate Prediction  </br>
Use several models to predict the churn rate of the telecom customers

## Model Used:  </br>
Logistic Regression </br>
Support Vector Machine </br>
Random Forest  </br>
KNN  </br>
Naive Bayes Classifier: Prior Probability to create a posterior probability based on couple of features  </br>
*from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB  </br>

Compare Confustion matrix, ROC, AUC to determine the model with best performance.

## Takeaways  </br>
Use Random Forest Classifier to identify the best features in the model
